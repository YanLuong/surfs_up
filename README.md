# Surfs Up

Background

My business plan is to set up a 'Surf and Shake' shop in Hawaii around the Oahu island. I've reached out to an investor called W.Avy for financial backing. To get W.Avy and his board of directors on board with this business venture, he has some weather concerns that need to be addressed and requires some analytics on weather data sets. In this analysis, we will focus on the temperature trends to determine if the ice cream and surf shop is sustainable all year round.
